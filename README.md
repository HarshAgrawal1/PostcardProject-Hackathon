# PostcardProject-Hackathon


We've developed software where users can select templates, currently offering the Christmas edition. Users simply provide the paragraph they want to include in the postcard design along with the email address for delivery. Each postcard sent out will be unique, personalized with the recipient's name. Users have the flexibility to make changes if needed. I'm currently working on integrating the email function using the Django framework.
